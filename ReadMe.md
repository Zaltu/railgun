# Railgun - Powered by the Stars
Railgun is a streamlined data management system powered by STELLAR.

### In more than a line
Railgun is a wrapper around PSQL for managing data within a relation database in a way that's intuitive for everyone. It includes both a web-based front-end and an accessible API for managing data, and particularly relations, without needing to deal with lower-level SQL implementation details. It's also infinitely scaleable (haha)!


## Features
- Use the integrated database or define any number of external PSQL database sources to wrap.
- Create database structures (tables, columns) seemlessly with no downtime.
- Define relations between entities without needing to deal with all the bs involved.
- Fully-featured web-based UI (haha WIP).
- Fully-featured REST API.
- Built for scaleability, spin up as many endpoints as needed.


## Deployment
